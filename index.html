"(boolean)..?" I said and looked around. "Not that I know of." "I was SURE that there was a/n (object) here before!" "Are you sure?" I asked. "Yes" He said with the start of a smile across his (body part). "How do you know?" I asked. "Because I (verbed) it." He/She replies as he/she pulls it out of his/her pocket.</p>

      <p>Then we hear this very loud, (adjective)-sounding noise come from the (direction) of us. We turn around and see a (creature). It is (adjective),  (adjective), and (adjective), except it has (noun)-shaped teeth and a (material) eye.  It was the possessed (type of toy) that I had when I was (1-digit number).</p>
